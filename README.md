# Sunrise-Sunset Plugin

This plugin creates BinarySensors that are triggered when sunrise or sunset is detected.

A sensor will be turned on at the start of the event and turned off at the end. For example, the sunrise sensor will be turned on at the start of sunrise, then turned off at the end of sunrise.

Install https://github.com/scryptedapp/ip-geolocation to create a position sensor to use in this plugin.
